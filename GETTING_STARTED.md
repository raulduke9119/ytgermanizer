2. **Interactive Workflow**
   The application will guide you through the process:
   1. Enter YouTube video URL
   2. Choose TTS model (Bark or Tacotron2)
   3. Select voice preset
   4. Configure speed and pitch settings
   5. Wait for processing
   6. Get your translated video!

## üéØ Example Session

```
Welcome to YTGermanizer! üé• üá©üá™

Please enter the YouTube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example

Choose TTS Model:
1. Bark (High quality, slower)
2. Tacotron2 (Faster, good quality)
Enter your choice (1/2): 1

Select German voice:
1. Male Speaker (v2/de_speaker_6)
2. Female Speaker (v2/de_speaker_7)
Enter your choice (1/2): 1

Processing your video:
1. Downloading video... ‚úÖ
2. Extracting audio... ‚úÖ
3. Transcribing... ‚úÖ
4. Translating to German... ‚úÖ
5. Generating German speech... ‚è≥
6. Synchronizing... 
7. Finalizing...

Your video will be saved in: downloads/output/translated_video_20241209_115448.mp4
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### TTS Models

1. **Bark**
   - Best for short videos (1-5 minutes)
   - Most natural-sounding speech
   - Multiple voice options
   - Requires NVIDIA GPU (no CPU support)
   - Not suitable for CPU-only systems

2. **Tacotron2**
   - Better for longer videos
   - Faster processing
   - Consistent quality
   - Single voice option
   - Works on both CPU and GPU
   - CPU mode available (slower but functional)

### Processing Times

**Tacotron2:**
- With GPU: ~10-20x realtime
- With CPU: ~30-50x realtime
  (e.g., 1-minute video takes 30-50 minutes to process)

**Bark:**
- Requires GPU: ~30-40x realtime
- No CPU support available

### Hardware Recommendations

For best experience:
- **Using Bark:** NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM required
- **Using Tacotron2 with GPU:** Any NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM
- **Using Tacotron2 with CPU:** Modern multi-core processor (expect longer processing times)

### File Management

The project maintains three main directories:
- `/downloads`: Main working directory
- `/downloads/temp`: Temporary processing files
- `/downloads/output`: Final output videos

Files are automatically cleaned up:
- Temp files: Immediately after processing
- Output files: Keeps last 10 by default

## üîç Troubleshooting

1. **Memory Issues with Bark**
   - Switch to Tacotron2 for longer videos
   - Close other GPU-intensive applications
   - Try processing in smaller segments

2. **FFmpeg Issues**
   - Ensure FFmpeg is in system PATH
   - Check FFmpeg installation: `ffmpeg -version`
   - For Windows: Restart terminal after installation

3. **Speed/Sync Issues**
   - Try different voice presets
   - Use Tacotron2 for better timing control
   - Check original video quality

4. **Network Issues**
   - Verify YouTube URL accessibility
   - Check internet connection
   - Consider using a VPN if services are blocked
